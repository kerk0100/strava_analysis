# Filter
This feature allows the user to filter through their activities based on activity type, distance, and date. The user then can select which metrics they wish to view for the filtered activities: Name, Distance, Average Speed, Moving Time, and/or Date.
The ID of the activity is default, and it always shown. There is a link from the ID column to the acitvity on strava.com. Below is an example of filtering rides that are greater than 100km, and between Jan 31 2019 and Dec 1 2021:
